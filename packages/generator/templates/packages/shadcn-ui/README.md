## shadcn/ui Components

This project uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for its UI components. These are built on top of Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS.

To add a new component:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

Components are added to the `src/components/ui` directory and can be imported and customized as needed.
